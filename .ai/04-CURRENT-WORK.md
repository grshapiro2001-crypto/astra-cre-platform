## Notes for Next Claude Code Session

**Before starting any coding:**
1. Read `.ai/01-CORE-RULES.md` - Know the standards
2. Check `.ai/03-CODEBASE.md` - Don't rebuild what exists
3. Verify this file - Am I working on the right task?

**Budget Awareness:**
- Target: Keep sessions under $30
- If task looks bigger, break it into smaller pieces
- Always estimate before starting
