## 🎯 DISCOVERY CRITERIA

**We're looking for tools that:**
- ✅ Enhance document extraction accuracy (better than current 95%)
- ✅ Improve data visualization (maps, charts, dashboards)
- ✅ Automate workflows (deal intake, notifications, reporting)
- ✅ Reduce Claude API costs (caching, optimization)
- ✅ Speed up development (component libraries, boilerplate)
- ✅ PropTech/CRE specific (not generic SaaS)

**We're NOT interested in:**
- ❌ Generic AI chatbots (we have Claude)
- ❌ Enterprise-only tools (need SMB pricing)
- ❌ Overhyped with no clear ROI
- ❌ Requires major infrastructure changes

# 🔍 STEP 2: REFINE TOOL DISCOVERY CRITERIA

**Let me update Task 6 with more specific criteria:**

## **ENHANCED TOOL SCOUT - REFINED VERSION**

**Replace Task 6 instructions with this:**
```
GOAL: Find AI tools that directly solve Astra CRE problems.

DAILY SCAN (6:00 AM):

- Hacker News: Top 30 posts with keywords: AI, tools, automation, real estate
- Reddit r/artificial: Hot posts (top 10)
- Reddit r/SideProject: Posts with "AI" or "automation" (top 10)
- X/Twitter: Search recent tweets with #AITools #BuildInPublic (last 24 hours)

SPECIFIC USE CASES TO MATCH:

🎯 HIGH PRIORITY (Solve current pain points):
1. **PDF Extraction Enhancement**
   Keywords: PDF, document extraction, OCR, financial data
   Current: 95% accuracy with Claude
   Goal: Find tools that could push to 98%+

2. **Map Visualization Libraries**

4. **Cost Optimization**
   Keywords: LLM caching, prompt optimization, token reduction
   Current: $0.50-$2 per document
   Goal: Reduce to <$0.50

5. **Workflow Automation** (lightweight)
   Keywords: webhook automation, zapier alternative, no-code
   Current: Manual processes
   Goal: Automate deal intake emails

🎯 MEDIUM PRIORITY (Nice to have):

# 🚀 STEP 3: ADDITIONAL AUTOMATION IDEAS

## **TASK 7: Budget Alert System**

**Task Name:** `Astra CRE - Budget Watchdog`

**Trigger:** After each logged session OR daily at 9 PM

**Instructions:**
```
GOAL: Warn Griffin if spending is trending high.

READ: /Users/griffinshapiro/Documents/Claude Test/.ai/SESSION-LOG.md

CALCULATE:
- Total spent this week (sum all session costs)
- Total spent this month
- Average per session
- Sessions per week

BUDGET THRESHOLDS:
🟢 Green: <$50/week
🟡 Yellow: $50-100/week  
🔴 Red: >$100/week

IF YELLOW OR RED:
Send alert email/notification:

Subject: 💰 Astra CRE Budget Alert

You've spent $[X] this week ($[Y] this month).
Current pace: $[Z]/month

Recent sessions:
- [Date]: $[X] - [What was built]
- [Date]: $[X] - [What was built]

Suggestions:
- Batch similar tasks (3 in one session vs 3 sessions)
- Use manual coding for small tweaks (<10 lines)
- Review prompt efficiency in .ai/05-PROMPTS.md

Budget pace: [On track / Review needed]
```

## **TASK 8: Feature Progress Tracker**

**Task Name:** `Astra CRE - Feature Momentum`

**Trigger:** Every 3 days at 8 PM

**Instructions:**
```
GOAL: Track if active features are making progress or stalled.

READ: 
- /Users/griffinshapiro/Documents/Claude Test/.ai/04-CURRENT-WORK.md
- /Users/griffinshapiro/Documents/Claude Test/.ai/SESSION-LOG.md

FOR EACH ACTIVE TASK:
- When was it added?
- How many sessions worked on it?
- Is it progressing or blocked?

IDENTIFY STALLED TASKS (no progress in 7+ days):
Send notification:

⚠️ TASK HEALTH CHECK

Stalled (7+ days no progress):
- [Task name] - Added [Date], Last worked [Date]
  Reason: [Blocker if listed, or "No recent sessions"]

Action needed:
□ Is this still a priority?
□ Are there blockers to resolve?
□ Should this move to backlog?

## **TASK 10: GitHub Commit Reminder**

**Task Name:** `Astra CRE - Git Safety Net`

**Trigger:** End of any session where code was modified

**Instructions:**
```
GOAL: Ensure Griffin commits work to GitHub.
